# siloam.github.io #"UNDER CONSTRUCTION"-
The Siloam is an initiative which got its formation in this time of pandemic so , well this is the reason why this was created. I wanted to promote the “open source “ among the communities so , as well as help the community during this pandemic . So this Siloam is an online web-based app which will be having a set of questions . The questions will basically be the  symptoms of Covid-19 . Now , the people will choose whether they have some symptoms or they don't from the given choose . So , based upon their answers the possibility will be shown like for example 10% or 25% something like that . These are just predictions which can help them to know  about the possibilities and can make them aware about the Covid 19 symptoms .
